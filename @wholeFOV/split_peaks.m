% finding big differences in slope of locally fitted lines (with least-squares) 
% using a stencil that takes the point and points forward (controlled by stencil).
%
% Note: At the beginning of the signal, there may be a portion of peak, but if no 
% kink is observed, these piece of peak will receive the value (peakID==0) and it
% won't be analyzed, as it is incomplete.
